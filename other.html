            <p>This project was a Graphical User Interface(GUI) that could have the ability to create squares, triangles and circles by clicking on the respective shape. There is also functions to sclae up or down the size of an image once its clicked on, it can be moved above or below other shapes, it can be rotated and you also have the option to delete the selected shape. All the work was carried out in Adobe Flash using ActionScript and the graphics were created in Adobe Photoshop. Please feel free to try out the interface in all its glory. </p>

            <p>This Video was created for C.A.R.E. Cancer Support Centre in Clonmel, Co. Tipperary as part of an team based assignment. I worked on the project in all stages of pre-production, production and also post-production. In pre-production I helped scriptwrite the questions to be asked and also the layout for camera position and lighting as well as location scouting. In the production phase I was cheif cinematogropher and also photographer for still shots so I had almost complete control over the camera movements. In post production I was the master editor who got cuts of raw footage and compiled them into a coherent sequence and also synced up the audio to the video.

            <p>This project was to recreate a comic book and make it an audio track. As part of a three person team I shared responsability in planning the project, creating foley(simulated sounds) and then in actually speaking the dialogue. I then had full control over compiling the track in a Digital Audio Workstation(DAW) called Reaper and fitting all the sounds and dialogue together. </p>

        <h3> 3D Modelling</h3>

        <p>This project I completed in Autodesk Maya. I began by taking some source photography of the real world object in a scene and then shot a scene on camera with no object in the scene. I then modelled the clock and sized it accurately by referencing my source photography. I proceeded to texture my clock by using photoshop and applying textures. After this was complete I set up my earlier scene with no clock in it, added my model and lighted the scene. Finally I rendered out the project in Mental Ray which is a plug in for Maya and the end result is the video you see above. </p>
