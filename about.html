        	<p>Hi, I’m Steve and I like to design things. I like graphic design and web design primarily and I am also interested in photography and video. I’m currently a 3rd Year Creative Multimedia student at Limerick School of Art and Design. I originally come from a rural part of Laois and currently reside in Clonmel, Tipperary.</p>

			<p>I focus mainly on design based work but I am also proficient in Back End Web Development, Video Production and Post Production, Programming and also Computer Generated Imagery. Just some of the tools of my trade are the Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, After Effects, Premier Pro and Flash Professional), Autodesk Maya, Reaper, Processing and Garage Band.</p>

			<p>When I’m not being creative at my computer I enjoy Archery, Photography, Rugby and traveling to new places among other things. I also have a passion for electronics as I studied Electrical Engineering many moons ago. If I get bored you may find me fixing old obsolete technology or playing around with circuit boards.</p>
